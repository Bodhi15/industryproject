**INTRODUCTION:**

Education is an important element of the society, every government and country in the world work so hard to improve this sector. With the corona-virus outbreak that has disrupted life around the globe in 2020, the educational systems have been affected in many ways; studies show that studentâ€™s performance has decreased since then, which highlights the need to deal with this problem more seriously and try to find effective solutions, as well as the influencing factors.

**MOTIVATION:**
The educational systems need, at this specific time, innovative ways to improve quality of education to achieve the best results and decrease the failure rate.

As students of the IT department who studied in the last month a little about machine learning, we know that in order for an institute to provide quality education to learners, deep analysis of previous records of the learners can play a vital role, and wanted to work on this challenging task.

**Problemetic:**
As already mentioned, with the help of the old students records, we can came up with a model that can let us help students improve their performance in exams by predicting the student success. So, it is obvious it's a problem of classification , and we will classify a student based on his given informations, and we will also use diffrent classifiers such as KNN or SVM classifier and compare between them. Many factors affect a student performance in exams like famiily problems or alcohol consumption, and by using our skills in machine learning we want to :


    1) predict whether a student will pass his final exam or not.
    2) came up with the best classifier that is more accurate and avoid 
    overfitting and underfitting by using simple techniques.
    3) know what the most factors affect a student performance.
So, teachers and parents will be able to intervene before students reach the exam stage and solve the problems.
